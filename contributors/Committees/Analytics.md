1. providing actionable insights through weekly reports and/or streaming analytics
2. making custom tools in the Secret Analytics committee github repository
3. providing consulting given the context of the task at hand.

In summary, the community shall determine the questions which need to be answered; the committee shall devise a tailored action plan by bringing together the correct parties/skillsets. These contributions have the goal of facilitating collaboration between the correct parties in a timely fashion.

The committee shall have as its activities.

Quantifying the likelihood of possible outcomes surrounding targeted action.

Optimizing targeted actions by providing alternatives to said actions given possibile uncertainty.
Building and maintaining tooling, infrastructure, and ETLs.
The community can submit questions to the #analytics committee Discord channel. The committee will operate in 2 week sprints. Depending on interest, questions, and future use-cases, we will split our time between directly answering questions and building and maintaining infrastructure for easy analysis.

The issues to be submitted to the committee must define the analytics question with the following elements:

High level summary of question
Motivations and benefits that would be gained from having these questions answered.
What actionable decisions could be made by answering the question
Who benefits from the question being answered.
The weekly update from the committee shall provide a continuous progress report of actions affected by the analyses. The detailed source reporting of this weekly update will be made available on the Secret Analytics github repository.

The leaders of this committee would be tasked with coordinating the committee by delivering the weekly updates, conducting meeting proceedings, and establishing working groups for committee deliverables.
