## Design Committee Charter

### Purpose
The Design Committee is a space for interested community members, designers, and other creatives to gather, discuss, collaborate on, and contribute to design for Secret Network and projects, efforts, and initiatives within it.

Design includes, but is not limited to:
Graphic Design
Visual Design
User Interface Design
User Experience Design
User Research
Usability Testing
Content Creation
Responsibilities
The following responsibilities are shared amongst all members of the Design Committee, but accountability ultimately lies with the Design Committee lead(s):

Encourage collaboration between committee members and Secret Network projects, efforts, and initiatives with design needs
Promote design best practices within the Secret Network ecosystem, including user-friendliness, usability, inclusivity -- and design which supports Secret Network’s mission and vision.
Share design assets, knowledge, and resources with other members and the larger community to foster a decentralized, collaborative, and iterative design environment
Provide a structured format for the community provide constructive feedback on design, as-needed
Recommend new design-related initiatives for funding

### Membership

The Design Committee primarily seeks members with design backgrounds and experience that benefit the committee’s mission and responsibilities, but values the membership of any interested community member looking to get more involved in Secret Network’s design space.

Membership involves being active and engaged in fulfilling the responsibilities of the Design Committee as your time and ability permits.

Design Committee Members are expected to:
Treat one another with respect
Promote healthy and friendly design discussion
Foster an inclusive and collaborative environment for all members
Contribute to design of Secret Network projects, efforts, and initiatives in a manner that fits your skills, background, or experience and the respective project, effort, or initiative’s needs
Have the willingness and ability to commit adequate time and effort to committee responsibilities and to the projects, efforts, initiatives you choose to design for
Design to serve the community; share and make accessible your work with others, allowing them to iterate, experiment, or reutilize it in order to continually advance design within the Secret Network ecosystem
Detach your ego from your work; understand that all people and designs are fallible and capable of being improved
Give design feedback constructively, empathetically, and respectfully; explain your reasoning behind suggested changes or improvements; and offer alternative approaches when possible.

### Design Committee Leads

Due to the breadth of design, the Design Committee has the potential for multiple committee leads, including subcommittee or ad-hoc committee leads (see Organization below).

Leads may be a member of the Design Committee that is in good standing with the Secret Network community; has relevant design-related skills, background, or experience; and a history of meaningfully contributing to the committee’s mission and responsibilities.

Committee leads are beholden to the community and can be removed from their position if they are not fulfilling their responsibilities or meeting the Design Committee and/or community’s standards.

Lead Responsibilities include:
Recruit community members into the Design Committee
Maintain a list of active and engaged Design Committee Members, their design skills, and contributions for recognition and potential recommendation to specific projects or tasks where their skills could be utilized
Organize and prioritize design requests from various sources each week and distribute to Design Committee members through the committee’s communication channels
Help facilitate the connection of committee members with Secret Network projects, efforts, and initiatives with design needs and vice versa
Organize and leading committee meetings (outlined in more detail in Meetings)
Collaborate with other committees
Gather feedback from Design Committee members and Secret Network community on design-related projects for potential funding
Evaluate design-related projects for potential fund allocation and oversee their fund allocation when applicable
Organization
Due to the breadth of design, the Design Committee has the potential for additional Design Subcommittees or Ad-Hoc Committees, focused on specific areas of design or specific projects, efforts, and initiatives, respectively.

These shall be formed by the Design Committee on an as-needed basis.

### Authority
In keeping with its values of decentralization, the Design Committee will utilize a consensus decision making process when possible. When consensus decisions are not possible, committee leads can help bring consensus to a resolve.

For design decisions, specifically, the Design Committee shall, on a case-by-case basis, evaluate the decision through a combination of: its adherence to design best practices, its fulfillment of Secret Network’s mission and vision, recommendations from relevant subject-matter experts within the committee, and/or design research and testing. The Design Committee will disseminate this relevant insight and information to Design Committee members. It will then utilize a consensus decision making process. When consensus decisions on design are not possible, committee leads can help bring consensus to a resolve.
Meetings
The Design Committee will conduct business of the committee through an ongoing schedule of weekly conference calls and discord communications.

Design Committee will be held on Tuesdays at 5PM UTC (i.e. 1PM EST, 12PM CT, 11AM MT, 10AM PT), beginning on Tuesday, May 4, 2021.


The Design Committee agenda shall be generally structured as follows:
Introduction of new committee members
Recognition of committee member contributions in the past week
Review of current available opportunities to contribute to design
Open forum for design review or discussion amongst Design Committee members (Note: this is not a forum for non-committee members to give feedback -- that will be handled through other means and channels)
Schedule further design discussion, review, collaboration, or other breakout sessions as-needed to support one another in their respective design efforts

Updating the Charter

The Design Committee recognizes that decentralized governance is a highly experimental and rapidly evolving structure. As such, the Design Committee shall review and reassess the adequacy of this Charter periodically as it deems appropriate. This Charter may be amended or modified by the Committee, subject to disclosure and off-chain voting via discussion in committee meetings and communicated on the Secret Network forums.
