## Education Committee Charter

### Purpose
The Education Committee exists to create, update, and manage educational content to accelerate the use and adoption of Secret Network. We work closely with other committees to ensure our output is relevant, and supports their goals.

### Key focus areas are:
Create and update educational material, including but is not limited to video content, infographics, written guides, etc.
Ensure education content can be found, and is easily browsable
Maintain the FAQ of the Secret Network
Liaison with the Development Committee to ensure new products are accompanied/followed-up by the necessary education material
Liaison with the Awareness Committee to ensure we produce content that resonates with the broader cryptocurrency space

We understand not everyone is an engineer: active community members run local events, design graphics and user experiences, write copy, help manage support requests, and do so much more. The Education Committee offers a way for all these unique individuals to participate within the Secret Network ecosystem through education focused projects that have a direct hand in helping others understand the value of our project and teach others how to navigate and utilize the various applications in our ecosystem. Contributors to the education committee earn community points/rewards for their contributions to helping with these educational initiatives. 

### Membership
Although the Education committee primarily focuses on education, you do not need to be an educator or have an education-focused background to contribute. Infographics, video tutorials, FAQs; they all require a variety of skills to produce. The only thing one requires is a basic understanding of blockchain technology, and the unique attributes that Secret Network brings to the broader blockchain industry.

Membership involves being active and engaged in fulfilling the responsibilities of the Education Committee as your time and ability permits.

Education Committee Members are expected to:
Be kind, respectful, display integrity, and objectivity
Promote healthy and friendly discussion 
Foster an inclusive and collaborative environment for all members
Share educational content, knowledge, and resources with other members and the larger community to foster the use and adoption of Secret Network
Contribute and/or lead Secret Network education-focused projects, efforts, and initiatives in a manner that fits your skills, background, or experience and the respective project, effort, or initiative’s needs
Encourage collaboration between committee members and Secret Network projects, efforts, and initiatives with education content needs
Give feedback constructively, empathetically, and respectfully; explain your reasoning behind suggested changes or improvements; and offer alternative approaches when possible

### Education Committee Lead
Due to the wide-range of educational pursuits , the Education Committee has the potential for multiple committee leads, including subcommittee or ad-hoc committee leads (see Organization below).

Leads may be a member of the Education Committee that is in good standing with the Secret Network community; has relevant education-focused skills, background, or experience; and a history of meaningfully contributing to the committee’s mission and responsibilities.

Committee leads are beholden to the community and can be removed from their position if they are not fulfilling their responsibilities or meeting the Education Committee and/or community’s standards.

In addition to member responsibilities, committee lead responsibilities include:
Invite and recruit community members into the Education Committee
Guide new members to find their role in the Education Committee
Organize and prioritize education focused initiatives from various sources each week and distribute to Education Committee members through the committee’s communication channels
Organize and leading committee meetings
Maintain a list of active projects and initiatives, track their status, and see to it they are completed
Evaluate education-related projects for potential fund allocation and oversee their fund allocation when applicable
Initiate and boost collaboration with other committees

### Organization
The Education Committee has the potential for additional Education Subcommittees or Ad-Hoc Committees, focused on specific areas of education or specific projects, efforts, and initiatives, respectfully.

These shall be formed by the Education Committee on an as-needed basis.
### Authority
In keeping with its values of decentralization, the Education Committee will utilize a consensus decision making process when possible. When consensus decisions are not possible, committee leads can help bring consensus to a resolve.

The Education Committee shall, on a case-by-case basis, evaluate the decision through a combination of: its adherence to best practices, its fulfillment of Secret Network’s mission and vision, recommendations from relevant subject-matter experts within the committee, and/or research and testing. The Education Committee will disseminate this relevant insight and information to Education Committee members. It will then utilize a consensus decision making process. When consensus decisions are not possible, committee leads can help bring consensus to a resolve.
Meetings
The Education Committee will conduct business of the committee through an ongoing schedule of weekly conference calls and discord communications.

The Education Committee will be held on Thursdays at 3PM UTC (i.e. 11AM EST, 10AM CT, 9AM MT, 8AM PT).


The Education Committee agenda shall loosely be structured as follows:
Give announcements and highlight upcoming priorities that require immediate attention from the Education committee 
Highlight committee achievements and output of previous week
Coordinate with the Awareness committee for distribution of finished materials
Identify new education projects that committee members can lead and participate in
Review of proposed SNACs for consideration
Brainstorm session for new SNACs or Education initiatives
Schedule further education discussion, review, collaboration, or other breakout sessions as-needed to support one another in their respective project efforts
Open forum for review or discussion amongst Education Committee members

### Updating the Charter
The Education Committee recognizes that decentralized governance is a highly experimental and rapidly evolving structure. As such, the Education Committee shall review and reassess the adequacy of this Charter periodically as it deems appropriate. This Charter may be amended or modified by the Committee, subject to disclosure and off-chain voting via discussion in committee meetings and communicated on the Secret Network forums.
