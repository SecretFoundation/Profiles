### Purpose of the Governance Committee
The Governance Committee exists to promote transparent collaboration within the network and provide neutral discussions on proposals, voting, and governance issues. We work closely together with validators and other committees to ensure optimal support for the overarching Secret Network goals. It is vital to provide a space where thoughts and ideas can freely and respectfully be exchanged by anyone within the Secret Network to aid in reaching informed consensus on-chain.

Key focus areas are:
* Researching and signaling whether chain parameters should be updated.
* Discuss proposals before going on-chain to answer and incorporate raised questions / issues.
* Improve communication between validators and promote governance activity.
* Provide neutral discussions for opposing views in a respectful manner.

### Membership
The Governance committee encourages everyone, regardless of background, to contribute. Everyone has valuable input on governance-related issues, often inspired by one’s specific situation, history, and background. A basic understanding of blockchain technology, and the unique attributes that Secret Network brings to the broader blockchain industry is an advantage.

### Governance Committee Member Expectations
Membership involves being active and engaged in fulfilling the responsibilities of the Governance Committee as your time and ability permits.
Governance Committee Members are expected to:
* Be kind, respectful, display integrity, and objectivity.
* Promote healthy and friendly discussion.
* Foster an inclusive and collaborative environment for all members.
* Share governance-related content, knowledge, and resources with other members and the larger community to foster the use and adoption of Secret Network.
* Contribute and/or lead Secret Network governance-focused projects, efforts, and initiatives in a manner that fits your skills, background, or experience and the respective project, effort, or initiative’s needs.
* Encourage collaboration between committee members and Secret Network projects, efforts, and initiatives with governance content needs.
* Give feedback constructively, empathetically, and respectfully; explain your reasoning behind suggested changes or improvements; and offer alternative approaches when possible.

### Governance Committee Chair(s) Responsibilities
Chairs may be a member of the Governance Committee that is in good standing with the Secret Network community; has relevant governance-focused skills, background, or experience; and a history of meaningfully contributing to the committee’s mission and responsibilities.
Committee chairs are beholden to the community and can be removed from their position if they are not fulfilling their responsibilities or meeting the Governance Committee and/or community’s standards.
In addition to member expectations, committee chair responsibilities include:
* Remain neutral, abstain on proposals, and do not lobby, voice opinions publicly, or argue for specific stances.  
* Invite and recruit community members into the Governance Committee.
* Guide new members to find their role in the Governance Committee.
* Organize and prioritize governance focused initiatives from various sources each week and distribute to Governance Committee members through the committee’s communication channels.
* Organize and chair committee meetings.
* Act as a neutral party to ensure fair and transparent discussions.
* Maintain a list of active projects and initiatives, track their status, and see to it they are completed.
* Initiate and boost collaboration with other committees.
* Track governance-related metrics.

### Scope of Work
The scope of work gives an overview of the work that the Governance Committee does continually, as well as an overview of the work the committee is looking to do during the funding period. As with much in the crypto industry, the committee will remain flexible when high impact opportunities present themselves.
 
### Continual Deliverables
* Coordinate and provide feedback on governance proposals and initiatives.
* Bring all committees together and have meta-committee discussions.
* Support anyone interested in learning more about Secret Network governance.
* Organize and manage the Governance Committee and its projects.
* Provide a neutral platform to discuss the Secret Foundation Transparency Reports.
* Function as program management for all governance related SNACs.
* Create processes so the governance committee remains stable and uniform across proposals.

### Project Deliverables
* Develop a Community Curated Bounty List which results in an on-chain signaling proposal to verify community support.
* Set up regular lines of communication between validators and the Governance Committee, in addition to a bi-monthly validator questionnaire.
* Increase governance awareness on social media channels such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit.

### Reporting
The Governance Committee will provide weekly updates. These updates are discussed during the weekly committee call, and are communicated on the forums, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit.

### Organization
The committee consists of a Chair and the Committee Members. On a project by project basis committee members can fulfill a project lead role. Anybody in the community can join the Governance Committee by participating in the Governance Committee Chat on Discord and/or Telegram and/or participating in the weekly Governance calls. No sign-up is required, although we strongly recommend members to sign up for the Secret Agent Program to be rewarded for their contributions. The Governance Committee has the potential for additional Governance Working Groups focused on specific areas of governance or specific projects, efforts, and initiatives. These shall be formed by the Governance Committee on an as-needed basis.

### Authority
The Governance Committee has no inherent authority, it merely aims to support on-chain governance and thereby strengthen the chain’s authority.
 
### Meetings
The Governance Committee will conduct business of the committee through an ongoing schedule of weekly conference calls and Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and Reddit  communications. The Governance Committee meeting will be held on Wednesdays at 3PM UTC (i.e. 11AM EST, 10AM CT, 9AM MT, 8AM PT).
The Governance Committee agenda shall loosely be structured as follows:
* Opening and changes to the agenda
* Welcome newcomers and give them a chance to briefly introduce themselves
* Verify previous meeting’s notes
* Go over current action points
* State of the chain
* Highlight new and upcoming on-chain proposals
* Go over the latest governance related metrics
* Main topics
* Discuss current governance related topics
* Closing
* Recap of the main takeaways of the meeting
* Assign new action points
* Propose topics for next week’s meeting
* Open Floor
* Updating This Charter

The Governance Committee recognizes that decentralized governance is a highly experimental and rapidly evolving structure. As such, the Governance Committee shall review and reassess the adequacy of this Charter periodically as it deems appropriate. This Charter may be amended or modified by the Committee, subject to disclosure and off-chain voting via discussion in committee meetings and communicated on the Secret Network forums. At the very least the charter is updated with every new round of on-chain funding.
