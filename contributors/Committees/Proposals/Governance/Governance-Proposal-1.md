# Governance Committee Funding Proposal
This proposal is for the on-chain funding period 08 August 2021 to 07 November 2021.

# Purpose of the Governance Committee
The Governance Committee exists to promote transparent collaboration within the network and provide neutral discussions on proposals, voting, and governance issues. We work closely together with validators and other committees to ensure optimal support for the overarching Secret Network goals. It is vital to provide a space where thoughts and ideas can freely and respectfully be exchanged by anyone within the Secret Network to aid in reaching informed consensus on-chain.

# Notable Deliverables in This Funding Period
### Continual Deliverables:
* Coordinate and provide feedback on governance proposals and initiatives.
* Bring all committees together and have meta-committee discussions.
* Support anyone interested in learning more about Secret Network governance.
* Organize and manage the Governance Committee and its projects.
* Provide a neutral platform to discuss the Secret Foundation Transparency Reports.
* Function as program management for all governance related SNACs.
* Create processes so the governance committee remains stable and uniform across proposals.
 
### Project Deliverables:
* Develop a Community Curated Bounty List which results in an on-chain signaling proposal to verify community support.
* Set up regular lines of communication between validators and the Governance Committee, in addition to a bi-monthly validator questionnaire.
* Increase governance awareness on social media channels such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit.

# Performance Indicators by Which the Committee Can Be Held Accountable
Ultimately we believe the Governance Committee should be judged on its added value to the network. Currently, there is no ability to effectively measure that added value directly. However some indirect possibilities exist:
* For on-chain proposals and validator activity within governance we propose a high level KPI that captures voting behavior: Average percentage of voting power that voted in proposals over the charter 3-months period. Voting behavior will change based on the specific proposal, but an average of 50% or more of voting power consistently being used is consistent with past months. Additionally, quorum (33%) should be reached on all proposals to ensure the community adequately responds to all proposals.
* For validator-committee communication we propose a high level KPI that captures validator engagement: Percentage of validators that respond to bi-monthly surveys. Surveys typically have a high likelihood of a low response rate, but considering the importance of validators in on-chain governance we aim for a 33% response rate for the first survey.
