# WhisperNode

WhisperNode has invested a lot of time and effort into setting up a secure, robust validator node. We're deeply ingrained in and involved in the creation of the Secret Network Community through secret committee participation, governance, education, content creation, and more. We have a passion for this project, and contribute to the shared vision any way we can.
