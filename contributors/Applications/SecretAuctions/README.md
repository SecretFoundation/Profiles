#### The first and only crypto auction platform with privacy by default is now LIVE. Bid for any secret token, with any secret token. Try it now!

Building on top of the amazing work of Baedrick (aka Mr. RobotoðŸ¤–'s Secret) with his Sealed Bid Auction and Secret Auction Factory contracts, the Secret Auction web3 app is now the first and only crypto auction platform with privacy by default. It's also really cool.

Starting today, you can visit https://auctions.scrt.network and create or bid on auctions for any SNIP-20 token (Secret Token) trustlessly, with minimal fees, and most importantly, with privacy preserved throughout.

Bids are completely secret: Bidders can't see if there are any other bids, and sellers can only know if there have been any bids, but not how many. Additionally, until the auction is closed, no price info about any bids is known by anyone, and after the auction is closed the only information revealed is the winning bid. This is the first time this been possible on a blockchain application without a trusted third part - another first for Secret Network.
