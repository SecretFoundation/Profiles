In Secret Heroes, each hero comes with a unique skin and a randomly-generated statline across 4 different skills: Weapons, Engineering, Biotech, and Psychics. Heroes can be minted in packs of three for just 1 SCRT and there are endless combinations to collect.

Each hero is a secretNFT. This means you own all your heroes and their skin and statlines are private metadata, allowing for privacy-preserving gameplay not found on any other blockchain.

Choose a hero and send it to battle against two other players. In each battle, the game randomly chooses a skill. The hero with the highest stat for the chosen skills is crowned the victor. Each time you win a battle, your hero’s stats will improve. The tougher the opponent you beat, the greater the stat increase. Be careful though, losing battles can cause you to lose stats!
