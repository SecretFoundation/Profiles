About Fardels:
Social media has become integral to how content creators like musicians, writers, artists, and entertainers publish their creations with the world. Although social media has made it possible to more directly share what you make, because the networks are centralized, the development of comparable mechanisms whereby the consumers of the content directly compensate people for what they bring to the community has been elusive.

Ever since the creation of smart contracts there has been a promise of building new kinds of decentralized social networks that can solve this problem. In practice what has been built have been impoverished clones of existing social networks (for example, EtherTweet) that lack key features, such as the ability to follow others. That is because most smart contract networks do not (and cannot) keep user data private. Plus, they have not innovated around the strengths of the blockchain to rethink the types of relations that social networks aim to foster.

Fardels aims to improve on both counts. By building on Secret Network, important aspects of user data can be kept private. And just as Twitter innovated around sharing short pieces of information, Fardels is designed to foster a culture of sharing digital items of small value. A fardel is a bundle or collection of information that you carry to the decentralized web to share with others. The contents of a fardel can be a link to a music file, an image, or even a short piece of text like the punchline to a joke. It is something others are willing to pay a small price to access (e.g., no more than 5 SCRT and perhaps considerably less), and because the price is low there is little risk in unpacking one.

There are also no limitations on what kinds of data are shared. It can be a link to an immutable file on IPFS or a simple Dropbox link. Thus, the contents can be permanent on the blockchain or they can be ephemeral, copyable, deletable, sharable. You can think of them as anti-NFTs, because the content creator earns money based on the number of users who create demand to unpack the fardels, not because of their high value. If the fardel was something that made you smile, that you found useful, or simply valued in some way then you can leave a positive comment and rate it up, so others will know it is something they might want to unpack as well. And if the contents are a let down or disappear, well... you can write a negative comment and rate it down.

Over time, content creators who create quality content will get good ratings and will begin to gain social capital in the community. People will trust them and want to unpack more of what they have to offer.
